<h3>What does the Predict Next Word application do?</h3>
<p>This application predicts the most probable word to follow the phrase entered in the <b>Enter phrase</b> field.  It displays its prediction and a bar chart of the words with the highest probabilities computed from the model used by the predictor.</p>

<h3>How are the predictions generated?</h3>
<p>The predictor is an implementation of the <b>Katz BackOff Trigram</b> (KBOT) language model.  Details of how this model was constructed can be found here:</p>

<h3>User Selected Parameters</h3>
<h4>Quick Start</h4>
<p>The left pane of the app is where you chose the settings for the word predictor.  All settings have default values.  To run a prediction, simply enter a phrase, chose your desired settings (or use the defaults) and click the <b>Predict next word of phrase</b> button.  A neon green bar will appear across the top of the window while the model is doing its computations if you are on the <b>Predict</b> tab.  When those computations are complete, the predicted word with the highest probability should be displayed in <b>Predicted Word</b> field to the right of the settings pane.  Below the <b>Predicted Word</b> field, should be a bar chart showing the highest probability words computed by the model used by the predictor.</p>

<h4>Enter phrase</h4>
<p>Enter a phrase for which you want to make a prediction of the word that follows.</p>

<h4>Corpus</h4>
<p>The predictor utilizes one of three corpora from which it makes a prediction.  This a collection of text from which the model was trained.  The more representative the phrase is relative to a particular corpora, the higher the probability that the model will make an accurate prediction.  For example, if "he has stolen" were the phrase and the selected corpus was something like "Baseball commentary", the word "second" would have a higher probability than "cars", but this might reverse if the corpus was something related to say "News reports".</p>

<h4>Bigram Discount</h4>
<p>This is the amount of absolute discount removed from observed bigrams which is redistributed to the unobserved bigrams.  For more details regarding this parameter, see the <b>Accounting for Probability Mass of Unseen N-grams: Discounting</b> section on <a href=http://rpubs.com/mszczepaniak/predictkbo3model>this page.</a></p>

<h4>Trigram Discount</h4>
<p>This is the amount of absolute discount removed from observed trigrams which is redistributed to the unobserved trigrams.  For more details regarding this parameter, see the <b>Accounting for Probability Mass of Unseen N-grams: Discounting</b> section on <a href=http://rpubs.com/mszczepaniak/predictkbo3model>this page.</a></p>

<h4>Probability Bars</h4>
<p>This control tells the application how many bars to display in the probability bar chart.</p>

<h4>Predict next word of phrase</h4>
<p>Clicking this button tells the application to make a prediction of the next word based on the selected settings.</p>
